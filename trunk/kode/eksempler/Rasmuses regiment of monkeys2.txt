Hero "OldNeonMonkey"

A hero can become the captain of a regiment, if the hero comes adjacent to the regiment and the regiment does not have a captain. A regiment can only have one captain. If the hero simultaniously become eligible as captain for two regiments, the biggest regiment is chosen. If two regiments are tie in such a situation, the regiment is chosen randomly.
