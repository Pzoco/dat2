\section{Conclusion}
	The goal of the project was to make language, that when interpreted could emulate a game between multiple armies. 
	This goal have been fulfilled by programming a simulator, which can do syntactical analyzing, semantical analyzing and interpretation.
	Syntactical analyzing was done by recursive descent parsing the scripts written in WAR, the semantical analyzing was applied by using 
	a visitor pattern that could check for type and scope rules. The simulator part contains a interpreter that can interprete 
	a behaviours in the form of a abstract syntax tree, which is retrieved from the decorated abstract syntax tree.
