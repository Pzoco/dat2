\section{Conclusion}
	The goal of the project was to make language, that when interpreted could emulate a game between multiple armies. 
	This goal have been fulfilled by programming a simulator, which can do syntactical analyzing, semantical analyzing and interpretation.
	Syntactical analyzing was done by recursive descent parsing the scripts written in WAR, the semantical analyzing was applied by using 
	a visitor pattern that could check for type and scope rules. The simulator part contains a interpreter that can interprete 
	a regiments behaviours in the form of a abstract syntax tree, which is retrieved from the decorated abstract syntax tree. \\
	
	The focus of the project was never speed, because the language is so simple the parsing and decorating is done fast.
	It has neither been functionality we had to focus on getting the simulator to run the scripts. If we were to write another language 
	it could be interesting to have language constructs as variables,functions or records implemented.
