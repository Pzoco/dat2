	\subsubsection{Type rule binary expressions}
		$E1$ $O$ $E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean\\
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer \\
		and $O$ is spelled as $==,>=,<=,<$ or $>$
		
	\subsubsection{Type rule of arithmetic expressions}
		$I1 O I2$ is type correct and of type Boolean \\
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer \\
		and $O$ is spelled as $-,+,/$ or $*$

	\subsubsection{Type rule of control structures}
		$C(E)\{D\}$ is type correct\\
		if $E$ is of type Boolean and $D$ is type correct \\
		and $C$ is spelled as else if, if or while
		
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $=$}
		$ID = A$ is type correct\\
		if $ID$ and $A$ are type correct and of the same type.
		
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $Position$}
		$Position(I1,I2)$ is type correct and of type Position\\
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
