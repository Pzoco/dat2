	\subsubsection{Type rules of \textit{WAR}}

	\begin{typerule} 
		$I1$ $ o $ $I2$ is type correct and of type Integer \\
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer \\
		and $o$ is an operator where $o\in \{-,+,/,* \}$
	\end{typerule}
	\begin{typerule} 
		$C(E)\{D\}$ is type correct\\
		if $E$ is of type Boolean and $D$ is type correct \\
		and $C$ is a control structure where $C \in \{else$ $if, if, while\}$
	\end{typerule}
	\begin{typerule} 
		$ID = A$ is type correct\\
		if $ID$ and $A$ are type correct and of the same type.
	\end{typerule}
	\begin{typerule} 
		$Position(I1,I2)$ is type correct and of type Position\\
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\end{typerule}
	\begin{typerule} 
		$E1$ $ o $ $E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean\\
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer \\
		and $o$ is an operator where $o\in \{ ==,>=,<=,<,> \}$
