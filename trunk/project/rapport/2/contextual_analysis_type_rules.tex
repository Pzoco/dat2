	These are the rules that checks the expressions form, and the type validity.
	
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $<$}
		$E1 < E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $>$}
		$E1 > E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $==$}
		$E1 == E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $>=$}
		$E1 >= E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $<=$}
		$E1 <= E2$ is type correct and of type Boolean
		if $E1$ and $E2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $-$}
		$I1 - I2$ is type correct and of type Integer
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $+$}
		$I1 + I2$ is type correct and of type Integer
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $/$}
		$I1 / I2$ is type correct and of type Integer
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $*$}
		$I1 * I2$ is type correct and of type Integer
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $while$}
		$while(E)\{C\}$ is type correct
		if $E$ is of type Boolean and $C$ is type correct
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $if$}
		$if(E)\{C\}$ is type correct
		if $E$ is of type Boolean and $C$ is type correct
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $else if$}
		$else if(E)\{C\}$ is type correct
		if $E$ is of type Boolean and $C$ is type correct
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $else$}
		$else\{C\}$ is type correct
		if $C$ is type correct
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $=$}
		$ID = A$ is type correct
		if $ID$ and $A$ are type correct and of the same type.
	\subsubsection*{Type rule of $Position$}
		$Position(I1,I2)$ is type correct and of type Position
		if $I1$ and $I2$ are type correct and of type Integer
