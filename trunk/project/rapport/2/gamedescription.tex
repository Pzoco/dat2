\chapter{Game Description}
In this chapter we describe the general setting of the project. \\
The problem we want to solve is the following: we want to make a war simulation where competitors, 
instead of controlling the armies directly, are controlling them by scripting their behaviours. The winner is the scripter who makes the best script. 
This is an interesting and fun problem, but also challenging because it requires a lot of expertise in language design and compiler techniques.
The simulation or 'game' based on our scripting language is described in detail in this chapter.
