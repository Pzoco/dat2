\section{The Idea}
	The main idea of the game was to create a framework, consisting of a simulator for at simple turnbased game, and a language which enables the players of this game to specify their strategy and behaviour using a programming language.
	We drew inspiration from many different sources, in order to come up with an aspect that was interesting, while being feasible with our current technical abilities.
	The framework and setting is mainly inspired by tabletop gaming, real-time Strategy games and Chess, coming together in a rather simple package to provide with a somewhat interesting abstraction for a simulation which is implemented in our own programming language.
	During the process we considered many different concepts, 
	and finally
	\begin{comment}we came to a decision that it would be more interesting to 
	have a controlled environment with a lot of units participating. The simulation would not be very interesting to perform when dealing with minor numbers, 
	the reasoning behind this is that we do not expect to make a very complicated simulation, therefore dealing in larger numbers proved 
	more interesting to us. \newline
	
	Ultimately\end{comment}
	we decided to create a war simulation, with two or more opposing forces 
	spawning in a grid like fashion. 
	
	Interesting aspects of a simulation of this sort, is to establish basic ground rules, 
	and see how the simulation plays out on it's own, given only basic instructions on how to start the simulation.
