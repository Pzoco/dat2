\\
References are gathered in a bibliography at the end of the report. Figures and tables are numbered in accordance with Chapter and section numbers throughout the report. \\
\\
In addition to the report itself, is included a disc containing the source-code for further examination. \\
In order to run or compile this code a .NET Framework needs to be present and functioning on the machine. \\
Further information, or another copy of the source code may be obtained at http://cs.aau.dk/HERPDERP(Placeholder).
