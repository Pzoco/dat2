\section{ Description of the WAR\# language }

	This language should we read by a compiler which should simulate the script.
	
	In a config file made in common from the two participant they can choose how large or how small 
	they want the grid size of the match, and how many unit 	
	they both may own, and when the game should end. 
	This config file should be the rules of the game, 
	so you can change rules from game to game.
	Each participant shall make a script file they will give to the simulator, 
	which then will compile the script and simulate the battle. 
	These script files contain how many units and what kind of units the participant would like to use.

	The one who made the best script will win the game, so every participant have to script the best script, 
	and place the units in the best place on the grid.
