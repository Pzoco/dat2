\section*{How we plan to implement the idea}
In order to implement the idea described in section \ref{?}, we plan to make use of an interpreter. Our script will be written in our WAR-code, then compiled to CIL-code, which again is compiled to CLR, which can be run on a machine, capable of running .NET-programs.
