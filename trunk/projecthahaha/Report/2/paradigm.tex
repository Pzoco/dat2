\subsection{Language Paradigm}

We have chosen to build an interpreter which recognizes a imperative language. The language we have agreed on is called the WAR language, and this is an imperative language paradigm.

Since we use less mathematics in the WAR language a functional logic would not fit very well in our specific language.
