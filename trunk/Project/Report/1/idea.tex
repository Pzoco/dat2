\section{The Idea}
The main idea and thereby the purpose of this programming language-to-be was to create a scripting language for some sort of simulation. During our process of consideration we thought out many different concepts, and ultimately we came to a decision that it would be more interesting to have a controlled environment with a lot of units participating. Reasons for this is that the simulation would not be very interesting to perform when dealing with minor numbers, the reasoning behind this is that we do not expect to make a very complicated simulation, therefore dealing in larger numbers proved more interesting to us. \newline
Ultimately we decided to do a war simulation, with two or more opposing forces spawning in a grid like fashion. These forces would be composed of regiments of different types, with each regiment having a captain. The reasoning for having a captain is to introduce an element which could lead to some interesting even handling, eg. if the captain dies, something happens to the regiment, such as a decline of morale, speed, or behaviour.
