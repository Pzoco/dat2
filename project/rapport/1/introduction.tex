%Some BULLSHIT INTRODUCTION !!
Here will be an introduction to the project, which will be completed near the end of the project. As is tradition with introductions.
This is certainly not breaking with tradition.

\section{Purpose}
% Purpose sektionen er en fortsættelse af introduction der fortæller kort hvad meningen er med projektet, som så leder over i den mere præcise og korte definition i problem statement %
Strategy games is one of the more popular genres within the modern game-industry today. In strategy games, your victory or defeat depends primarily on the applied tactics. However, most modern strategy games leave room for error through inferior control or attention on the battlefield. Though this room for errors often make games more dynamic, as errors give opponents a chance to make a comeback, there doesn't seem to be any games which rewards a superior strategy. In order to determine if strategy games, with no chance of a comeback, would be interesting to play, a simple simulation engine with a related scripting language would suffice to experiment on.

\section{Problem Statement}
During the course of this project our goals were to:


\begin{itemize}
\item Apply concepts of programming languages design
\item Understand decision-making in the design-phase of a programming language
\item Provide a meaningful context for an implementation of a simple language
\item Implement our own interpreter or compiler
\end{itemize}
