\section*{How we plan to implement simulator}
	We will need to implement our very own scripting language, this scripting language has been named WAR.
	We will construct a simulator, which will do syntactical and contextual analysis of the scripts and 
	after this the scripts will be simulated. This simulator will be written in C\#.
	
	This is the overall meaning of the project - implementing our very own language, and understanding the process of making such a framework function properly
