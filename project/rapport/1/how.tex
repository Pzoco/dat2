\section*{How we plan to implement the idea}
We will need to implement our very own scripting language, this scripting language has been named WAR.
The language will be implemented as an interpreter, which runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR) - the .NET framework.

The language itself will be implemented with the use of C#, since this also runs on this framework.
