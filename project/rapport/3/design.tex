What are the design criterias for the WAR language, and where are our focus points.

\section{Focus area of the language}

The primary focus on this language, have been on writeability and somewhat readability which we think is easily fulfilled when writeability is the main goal. Thats why we have chosen to use the imperative programming paradigm, which we think is the easiest paradigm to beginners.  

Since this is a game engine and not life important, we still choose to watch it like it was life important, and a lost game could cost the contestant a lot of money or similar.
