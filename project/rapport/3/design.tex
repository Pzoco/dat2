What are the design criterias for the WAR language, and where are our focus points.

\section{Focus area of the language}

The primary focus on this language, have been on writeability and somewhat readability which we think is easily fulfilled when writeability is the main goal. Thats why we have chosen to use the imperative programming paradigm, which we think is the easiest paradigm to beginners. By easy witeability we mean that programming beginners should be able to write their own script and by that compete against eachother. The realiability of the programming language have also high priority, so that the program won't behave in an unexpected way, or a disastrous way.

Since this is a game engine and not life important, we still choose analyze it as it was very important, and a lost game could cost the contestant a lot of money or similar.
