\subsection{Language Paradigm}

We have chosen to build an interpreter which recognizes an imperative language. The language named "the \textit{WAR} language", is an imperative language paradigm.

Since we use less mathematics in the \textit{WAR} language a functional logic would not fit very well in our specific language. 
The overall idea of this scripting language is to change the flow of the simulation through simple assignments and control statements, defined in this imperative manner.
Since the Scripting of \textit{WAR} only alters the flow and state of the simulation, it is up to the simulation engine to handle the more functional aspects of the simulation.
