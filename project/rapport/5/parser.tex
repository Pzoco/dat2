\section{Construction of the parser}
	In this section we will describe how one can construct a parser from a EBNF, but first we will describe what a parser is and how it works.
	
	\subsection{Parsing strategies}
		The job of a parser is to check if a program is correct and 
		to determine the structure of the program, the latter is usually done by constructing a syntax tree.
		There are two common ways of checking this {\it Bottom-up Parsing} and {\it Top-Down Parsing}.
		
		\subsubsection*{Bottom-up Parsing}
			This way of parsing takes simple structures and combining them to more complex structures.
			We call this type of parsing for {\it LR parsing} because we read the text from the left and reduces to the right.

				\caption{Two different parse methods}\label{fig:parsers}
			\end{figure}
			
		\subsubsection*{Top-down Parsing}
			Top-down parsing figure \ref{fig:top_down} starts from the complex structures, and breaks them down into smaller parts.
			We call this type of parsing for {\it LL parsing} because we read the text from the left and make derivations to the left.
		
		\subsubsection*{Strengths and weaknesses}
			The most commonly used parsing strategy of the two is LR parsing, the reason for this is because it's faster than LL parsing.
			In this project, however we have chosen to make a LL parser because it's easy to make by hand and speed isn't important for us. 
			The type of LL parser we made is called a recursive descent parser.
			
	\subsection{Creating a recursive descent parser}
		A recursive descent parser is a LL parser which works by recursively going through the program.
		To construct this type of parser a EBNF is required and here is how it is made:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Make a scanner for reading chars and identifying them as terminals.
			\item Make a parse method for each non-terminal in the EBNF.
			\item Make a method that can accept terminals.
			\item In each of the parse method accept terminals and/or call other parse methods.
		\end{enumerate}
