\section{The Idea}
	The main idea of the game was to create a generic war game simulator, where through programming one could make many different types of 
	simulated battles. We drew inspiration from many different sources, in order to come up with an aspect that was interesting, while being feasible with our current technical abilities. The framework and setting is mainly inspired by tabletop games, real-time strategy games and chess, coming together in a rather simple package to provide with a somewhat interesting abstraction for a simulation which is implemented in our own programming language.
	During the process we considered many different concepts, and finally we decided to create a war simulation, with two or more opposing forces spawning in a grid like fashion. 
	
Interesting aspects of a simulation, of this sort, is to establish basic ground rules, and see how the simulation proceeds on its own, given only basic instructions on how to start the simulation.
