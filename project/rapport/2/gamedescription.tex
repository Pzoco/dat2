\chapter{Game Description}
In this chapter we describe the general setting of the project. \\
The problem we want to solve is the following: we want to make a programming video game where competitors, instead of being a human-being, are programs that execute. The winner is the programmer who makes the best program. This is an interesting and fun problem, but also challenging because it requires a lot of expertise in language design and compiler techniques.
The simulation or "game" based on our scripting language is described in detail in this chapter.
